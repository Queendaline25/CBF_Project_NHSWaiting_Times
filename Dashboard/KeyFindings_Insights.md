For provider catchement area deprivation as determined by decile number and total waiting.
The highest number of patients waiting for both 
Admitted and Non-admitted RTT were concentrated on IMD
3 and 5. Whereas the total waiting of the more affluent catchment area(IMD decile 9 and 10) has low waiting for non-admitted patients but insignificant changes for admitted RTT.

It is then safe to say that the more deprived catchment areas (IMD decile 1-3) have more waiting times when combined than the more affluent ones with the IMD decile of (9-10) in non-admitted RTT.

For admitted RTT, The total waiting waiting difference betweeen the affluent(IMD decile(9-10)) and most deprived(IMD decile (1-2)) is very minute to draw any meaningful conclusion. The fig 4.0 below explains all clearer.
